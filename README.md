# Tee-shirt song

You will also find a [C++ program](src/main.cpp) which runs the song! ðŸ˜Ž

The code below is actually implemented and programmatically outputs the lyrics, this is not hardcoded. The logic sits in a [separated file](src/logic.cpp).

## Disclaimer

I made this translation from a song's lyrics into source code with JavaScript in mind. But to actually implement it, I had to use a lower level language to overload operators, so I chose C++.

Because I used C++, the only difference you'll see between the original source code and the C++ implementation will be the strings (with the use double quotes instead of single quotes) and the lambda function syntax.

You can make your own tee-shirt with this "art", I own one personally. If you need the SVG file, just ask me.
